1. What is Docker?
Docker is an open-source lightweight containerization technology. It allows you to automate the deployment of applications in lightweight and portable containers 
and you can easly develop and shipping and deploy it.

2.What is Container?
What is a container in a Docker?
A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code,
runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

3. What is Docker Image ?
The Docker image help to create Docker containers. You can create the Docker image with the build command. Due to this, it creates a container 
that starts when it begins to run. Every docker images are stored in the Docker registry.

4. What is Docker Registry ?
Dockerâ€™s registry is called Docker hub, which allows you to store images privately or publically. In Docker hub, you can store millions of images.
Public registry and private registry

5.What is Docker Engine ?

6. What command you should see all running containers ?
CMD: docker ps -a

7.Write command to stop container ?
CMD: docker stop container-name

8.What command to run the image as container?
CMD: docker -d -it -p 80:80 --name <container-Name> <image-Name>

9.What is dockerFile ?
A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.
Commands: FROM, RUN, LABEL, COPY, ADD, EXPOSE

10. What is Docker Engine ?
Docker daemon or Docker engine represents the server. The docker daemon and the clients should be run on the same or remote host, 
which can communicate through command-line client binary and full RESTful API.

11.What is docker swarm ?
A Docker Swarm is a group of either physical or virtual machines that are running the Docker application and that have been configured to join 
together in a cluster. The activities of the cluster are controlled by a swarm manager, and machines that have joined the cluster are referred to as nodes.

12. How can you monitor docker in production environment ?
Docker states and Docker Events are used to monitoring docker in the production environment.

13. What are the states of docker container ?
Running, pause, Restarting, Exit

14. Where docker volume is stored ?
/var/lib/docker/volumes

15. What are the some docker important commmands ?
docker pull--> Download image
docker push --> upload image to registry
docker run --> To create container from docker image
docker exec --> To login container
docker images --> Show docker images in local hub

16. How does communicate between docker daemon and docker client ?
To communicate through Socket.IO, REST API, TCP

17. What are the commands to control Docker with systemd ?
systemctl start/stop docker
service docker start/stop

18. How does use JSON instead of YAML compose file?
docker-compose -f docker-compose.json up

19. What is the command to push new image to docker registry ?
docker push myorg/img

20. What is Docker-compose ?
Docker compose is tool to help to run multiple container in single file and that compose file created by YAML or JSON file.

21. Can you lose data when container exist ?
No, any data that your application writes to disk get stored in container. The file system for the contain persists even after the container halts.

22. What are the diffrent kinds of volumes ?
Bind mount--> To connect external storage device which means outsied of docker.
Volume Mount--> To mount file system
Tmfs mount--> To defualt connect to contaier memory.

23. What is docker trusted registry ?
Docker Trusted Registry (DTR) is the enterprise-grade image storage solution from Docker. You install it behind your firewall so that you can securely 
store and manage the Docker images you use in your applications.

24. What is Docker Namespace ?
Docker uses a technology called namespaces to provide the isolated workspace called the container. 
When you run a container, Docker creates a set of namespaces for that container. These namespaces provide a layer of isolation.

25. What are the 3 components of Docker Architucture ?
Client--> Docker provides Command Line Interface tools to the client to interact with Docker daemon.
Docker Host --> It contains container, images, and Docker daemon. It offers a complete environment to execute and run your application.
Registry--> A Docker registry is a storage and distribution system for named Docker images. The same image might have multiple 
different versions, identified by their tags.
